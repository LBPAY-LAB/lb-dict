---

## 17. Contingency Plans

### Scenario 1: Critical Blocker (>1 day delay)

**Action**:
1. PHOENIX escalates to CTO immediately
2. Team swarms to resolve blocker
3. Re-prioritize backlog, drop lowest-priority stretch goal
4. Extend daily standup to 30 min for coordination

---

### Scenario 2: Team Member Unavailability (>2 days)

**Action**:
1. Redistribute workload to backup owner
2. Reduce scope: Drop 1 stretch goal
3. Extend deadlines for affected documents (max 2 days into Sprint 4)
4. Update stakeholders on revised timeline

**Backup Owners**:
- NEXUS (Architect) → MERCURY (Backend Lead)
- MERCURY (Backend) → NEXUS (Architect)
- CIPHER (Security) → ATLAS (QA Lead)

---

### Scenario 3: Scope Creep (New requirements mid-sprint)

**Action**:
1. ORACLE evaluates urgency and impact
2. If critical: Swap with lowest-priority committed item
3. If non-critical: Add to Sprint 4 backlog
4. Update Sprint Goal only if business-critical
5. Communicate changes to stakeholders

---

### Scenario 4: Quality Issues (DoD failures in review)

**Action**:
1. Mandatory re-work within sprint
2. Pair programming/documentation sessions
3. Additional peer review cycle
4. If unresolvable: Move to Sprint 4, adjust scope
5. Root cause analysis in retrospective

---

## 18. Sprint Board Structure

### Kanban Board Columns

| Column | Definition | WIP Limit |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| **Backlog** | Not started, ready to pull | N/A |
| **In Progress** | Actively being worked on | 5 docs |
| **In Review** | Peer review or technical review | 4 docs |
| **Done** | DoD complete, approved | N/A |

### Work-in-Progress (WIP) Limits

- **In Progress**: Max 5 documents (prevent multitasking)
- **In Review**: Max 4 documents (prevent review bottleneck)

**Rationale**: Focus on completing documents rather than starting many

---

## 19. Knowledge Sharing

### Documentation Standards

All documents must follow:
- **Template**: Use templates from `/99_Templates/`
- **Naming**: `[DOC-ID]_[Title_Snake_Case].md`
- **Cross-references**: Absolute paths for links
- **Code blocks**: Language-specific syntax highlighting
- **Diagrams**: PlantUML, Mermaid, or C4 Model notation

### Knowledge Transfer Sessions

| Session | Date | Topic | Facilitator |
|---------|------|-------|-------------|
| **Architecture Deep Dive** | 2025-10-28 | DIA-004, DIA-005 walkthrough | NEXUS |
| **Temporal Workflows 101** | 2025-11-04 | TSP-001 implementation guide | MERCURY |
| **Integration Patterns** | 2025-11-06 | INT-002, INT-003 review | MERCURY |

---
