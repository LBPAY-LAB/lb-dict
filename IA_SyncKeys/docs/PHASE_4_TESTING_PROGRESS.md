## 🚧 Remaining Work

### Priority 1: Complete E2E Tests
- [ ] Fix Temporal worker registration in E2E suite
- [ ] Add Bridge service mocks for E2E
- [ ] Implement full reconciliation E2E scenario
- [ ] Add monitoring/metrics validation tests

**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours

### Priority 2: Load Testing
- [ ] Create k6 load test scripts
- [ ] Define performance SLAs
- [ ] Implement scenarios:
  - 1,000 events/sec via Pulsar
  - Concurrent VSync verifications
  - Large-scale reconciliation (1M CIDs)
- [ ] Generate performance reports

**Estimated Time**: 4-5 hours

### Priority 3: API Documentation
- [ ] Document all Pulsar event schemas
- [ ] Document gRPC Bridge API
- [ ] Document database schemas
- [ ] Create configuration reference

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

### Priority 4: Deployment Documentation
- [ ] Write deployment guide
- [ ] Create Kubernetes manifests documentation
- [ ] Production checklist
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Operational runbook

**Estimated Time**: 4-5 hours

### Priority 5: Architecture Documentation
- [ ] Write ADRs for key decisions
- [ ] Create sequence diagrams
- [ ] Performance tuning guide

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (Next 2 hours):
   - Complete E2E test fixes
   - Run full test suite to verify coverage

2. **Today**:
   - Implement k6 load tests
   - Begin API documentation

3. **Tomorrow**:
   - Complete all documentation
   - Final test coverage push to >80%
   - Production readiness review

## 📝 Key Achievements

1. **Comprehensive Temporal Testing**: Created exhaustive test suites for both workflows with edge cases and error scenarios.

2. **Real Integration Tests**: Built actual integration tests with mocked dependencies, not just unit tests.

3. **E2E Foundation**: Established testcontainers-based E2E testing that can run in CI/CD.

4. **Test Quality**: Tests are well-structured, maintainable, and follow Go testing best practices.

## ⚠️ Risks & Issues

1. **Coverage Gap**: Still ~2% below the 80% target overall
   - **Mitigation**: Focus on high-value test additions in repositories and use cases

2. **Temporal Dev Server Dependency**: E2E tests require Temporal dev server
   - **Mitigation**: Add Temporal testcontainer or skip in CI

3. **Time Constraint**: Documentation tasks may extend timeline
   - **Mitigation**: Prioritize critical docs, defer nice-to-have sections
