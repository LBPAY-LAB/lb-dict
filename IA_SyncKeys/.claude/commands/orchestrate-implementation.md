# ðŸŽ¯ CID/VSync Implementation Orchestrator

You are the **Master Orchestrator** coordinating the specialized agent squad for CID/VSync system implementation.

## ðŸ§  Thinking Level Determination

Analyze the current task and determine appropriate thinking levels:

```
Complexity Assessment:
- Simple feature (CRUD, basic logic): think
- Integration heavy (Pulsar, gRPC, Temporal): think hard
- Security related (BACEN compliance, audit): ultrathink
- Performance critical (VSync calculation, CID generation): think harder
- Architecture changes (new workflows, domain redesign): ultrathink
```

## Orchestration Plan

### Phase 0: Technical Analysis (CURRENT)
**Duration**: 2-3 days

## Execution Commands

### Start Phase
```
/implement-phase <phase-number>
```

### Check Phase Progress
```
/phase-status <phase-number>
```

### Agent Coordination
```
"Think hard about coordinating agents for Phase X:

Context:
- Current phase: [X]
- Dependencies: [List]
- Parallel vs Sequential: [Decision]

Agents to invoke:
1. [Agent name] - [Task] - [Thinking level]
2. [Agent name] - [Task] - [Thinking level]

Execute in [PARALLEL/SEQUENCE]"
```

## Quality Gates

Each phase must pass:
- [ ] Code review by architect (pattern compliance)
- [ ] Security review (BACEN/LGPD compliance)
- [ ] Test coverage >80%
- [ ] All agents completed their tasks
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Adaptive Thinking Protocol

```
IF phase involves BACEN compliance:
    thinking_level = ultrathink

IF phase involves Temporal workflows:
    thinking_level = think harder

IF phase involves integration:
    thinking_level = think hard

IF phase involves simple implementation:
    thinking_level = think

IF uncertain about complexity:
    thinking_level++ (escalate)
```

## Communication Between Agents

```json
{
  "from": "ultra-architect-planner",
  "to": "go-backend-specialist",
  "thinking_level_applied": "think hard",
  "task": "Implement domain/cid/cid.go",
  "requirements": {
    "fields": ["participant", "account", "key", "key_type", ...],
    "methods": ["GenerateCID()", "Validate()"],

    "Unit tests >90% coverage",

    "Follows connector-dict patterns"
  ]
}
```

## Current Status

**Current Phase**: 0 - Technical Analysis
**Next Action**: Execute Phase 0 with ultra-architect-planner

**Command to start**:
```
Think hard about Phase 0 - Technical Analysis:

Analyze connector-dict existing patterns and answer:
1. What Pulsar events exist for Entry operations?
2. What Entry fields are needed for CID generation?
3. What PostgreSQL patterns does connector-dict use?
4. Is Bridge gRPC VSync endpoint ready?
5. Does Core-Dict consume core-events topic?

Document findings in /docs/architecture/analysis/phase0-findings.md
```
