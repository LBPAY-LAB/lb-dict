3. **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**
   - Document significant architectural decisions
   - Follow ADR template: Context, Decision, Consequences
   - Track alternatives considered and rationale

4. **Technical Specifications**
   - Write detailed TechSpecs for components (Temporal, Pulsar, Redis, PostgreSQL)
   - Document deployment architecture
   - Define integration patterns
